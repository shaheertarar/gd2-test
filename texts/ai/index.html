            <p class="body-text">AI is rapidly shaping the marketing landscape. Your team will need to adapt its tech stack to keep up with the competition. Let’s look at what AI is and how you can use this technology to save time, improve the quality of your leads and, ultimately, make better sales. AI can replicate human discernment and make real-time decisions. In other words, artificial intelligence is programmed to think, act, and respond just like a real, live human.For example, automation requires manual data input to perform a certain task. Using an algorithm, that task will repeat, regardless of what the data says or if there’s an error. AI, on the other hand, is machine learning. Meaning it requires an input of data. As it processes the data, AI can recognize behavior patterns and errors, then adjust its functions and algorithms as needed. AI is growing in popularity and can be used across a variety of industries. Let’s take a look at the benefits of using it. AI is not to be confused with automation. Although both automation and AI use real-time data to perform a function, the mechanics and output are vastly different.</p>
