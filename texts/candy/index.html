Whether you indulge by yourself or share it with a friend, one thing that unites us all is our love of candy. It's more than just a sweet treat. Candy is part of our pop culture and many of our memories. Let the candy take you back, to adventurous bike rides with friends, and long summer days you thought you would never end. Be a kid again, or at least pretend you are! We've seen it all, in fact, we've tasted it all! But there are some classic, memorable candies that we can't live without.</p>
