                <p>French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other national varieties),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2] french-fried potatoes, or simply fries are batonnet or allumette-cut[3] deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.</p>
