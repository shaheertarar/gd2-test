                Tie-dyeing materials are generally white cotton or cotton-linen blended white cloth. The main dyes are plant indigo or Indigo (commonly known as Banlangen). The main steps of traditional tie-dyeing include tie-up, soaking, dyeing, drying, thread removal, rinsing and grinding. The key technology of tie-dyeing is tie-up technique and dip-dyeing process. The tie-up process is very complicated. The patterns of each tie-dyed cloth adopt several different tie-up needles, such as tie, pinch, crepe, bundle, wrap, twist, fold, fold, sew and pick. For repeated dyeing, it is necessary to go through many processes, sometimes several days before dyeing a piece of cloth. Besides the number of times of dyeing, the color of the dyed cloth is also related to the dyeing technology, the distribution of dyes, drying, climate and so on. Dyeing cylinder, dyeing rod, drying rack, stone mill and so on are its main tools.
